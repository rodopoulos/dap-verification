Security issues are one of the biggest internet banking challenges, as such systems are highly targeted by ciber criminals. Distinct security protocols were designed in order provide reliability to online banking transactions. The Dynamic Authorization Protocol is an interesting approach, where a shared key is defined between the User and the Bank for further being used in future messages. For each transaction, the User is challenged to retrieve a unique transaction code, using a smartphone as a third-party validation entity, scanning a QR-code for integrity checks, for being able to carry operations in a untrusted computer. However, the protocol is not formally checked. In this work, we intend to formally specify and verify this protocol, using a well known theorem proving technique, the Inductive Method. At the end, we hope to have one of either two results: a formal correctness proof of the protocol safety or a solid counter-proof of its failure.
